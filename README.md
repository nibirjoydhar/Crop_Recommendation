# Smart Crop Recommendation System

A machine learning-powered web application that helps farmers make data-driven decisions about crop selection based on soil conditions and environmental factors.

## Overview

This application uses advanced machine learning techniques to recommend the most suitable crops based on various environmental parameters:
- Soil composition (N, P, K values)
- Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity)
- Soil pH
- Rainfall

## Features

- Clean, intuitive web interface
- Real-time crop recommendations
- Support for 22 different crops
- Scientifically backed predictions using machine learning
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, Bootstrap 5
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Crop_Recommendation.git
   cd Crop_Recommendation
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:

   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## How to Use

1. Enter the following soil and environmental parameters:
   - Nitrogen content (in kg/ha)
   - Phosphorus content (in kg/ha)
   - Potassium content (in kg/ha)
   - Temperature (in Â°C)
   - Humidity (in %)
   - pH value (0-14)
   - Rainfall (in mm)

2. Click "Get Recommendation" to receive your crop suggestion
